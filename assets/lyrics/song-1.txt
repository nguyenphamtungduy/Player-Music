불 꺼진 romantic, all my life
내 주위는 온통 lovely day
내 눈 속에 비친 arrow sign
(Oh, why? Oh, why?)
(Oh, why? Oh, why?)
I'm feeling lonely (lonely)
그만 힐끗대고 말해줘요
Hold me (hold me)
다시 crying in my room
숨기고 싶어 (say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
또 꿈길을 걷는 every day
눈 뜨면 다시 또 flew away
Waiting around is a waste (waste)
나 솔직히 지금이 편해
상상만큼 짜릿한 걸까?
Now I'm so lonely (lonely)
매일 꿈속에서 연습했죠
Kiss me (kiss me)
다시 crying in my room
포기할까 봐 (say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
I'm so lonely, hold me tightly
짜릿한 걸 원해
Who will really love me truly?
내게 기다림은 없어 I can't wait
더는 믿지 않아 now I'm gonna make it mine
Love is a light, I'll show my love is right
It's not a joke, so give it to me right now
No more chance to you
You know? Hey, d-d-d-dumb boy
꿈속에 매일 밤
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool, a fool for love
A fool for love
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid (hopeless girl is seeking)
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid (someone who will share this feeling)
다시 한번 못 들은 척 기회를 줄게 (I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb (a fool for love, a fool for love)
